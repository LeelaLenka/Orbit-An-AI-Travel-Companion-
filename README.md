# Orbit: AI Travel Companion v3.1

Orbit is a high-performance AI travel companion with an **Orange & Green** high-contrast aesthetic. It leverages advanced Gemini AI to support travel to **any town or city in the world**.

## Major Capabilities

### 1. Global Orbit Scan
The search system is no longer limited to mock data. Using the **Orbit Scan** button, you can type any location (e.g., "Munnar", "Grindelwald", "Small Town in France") and the AI will generate:
- Comprehensive daily cost breakdowns in **INR**.
- Local laws and specific customs to avoid legal risks.
- Emergency contact numbers (Police/Medical).
- Healthy local food recommendations.

### 2. High-Tech Sidebar & Navigation
- **Explore**: Find any global destination with the budget-aware scan tool.
- **Orbit Agent**: Your AI consultant for deep research and real-time planning.
- **Visited Places**: A full log of confirmed travel tickets with a feedback system.
- **Global Maps/VR**: Simulated 360-degree immersion and live interactive maps.

### 3. Voice & Regional Translation
- A built-in regional translator. Type a sentence and select a target language (any language name like "Hindi", "Russian", "Tamil") to hear the translation instantly.

### 4. Smart Logic
- Automatically detects user location (with permission).
- Calculates multi-modal travel costs (Walk, Bike, Car, Flight) for any scanned destination.
- Unified Orange/Green theme for safety and visual energy.

## Setup
Orbit relies on the `@google/genai` SDK for all intelligence features. Ensure your `process.env.API_KEY` is configured correctly.
